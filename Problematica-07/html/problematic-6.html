          The social network Twitter expanded its experience of live audio conversations Twitter Spaces, similar to the popular voice social network Clubhouse, and is now available in beta for users of mobile phones with Android operating system.
        </p>
        <p class="text-article">
          Twitter Spaces was announced in November and in December 2020 it began to be tested among users of Apple's iOS phones, at that time among a reduced number of users in beta, although now the function has been extended to more communities on the platform.
        </p>
        <p class="text-article">
          <span id="important-text">Twitter has now announced the arrival of the Spaces beta for Android devices as well.</span> Starting in the next few days, <span id="important-text">users with access to the beta will be able to listen and speak in conversations</span> through Spaces, and the possibility of being a host will arrive "in the short term," according to the social network.

        <p class="text-article">
          Spaces offers a similar operation to that of the voice social network that started this trend, Clubhouse, and allows you to have live audio conversations moderated by a host, in which you can participate as an exponent, speaking, or as a listener.
        </p>
        <p class="text-article">
          Joining a space on Android is possible through the purple aura displayed on the <span id="important-text">Fleets</span> line, by tapping to join, or also through a link shared through tweets or direct messages, for example.

        <p class="text-article">
          Android people can <span id="important-text">also use emojis</span> to react, view captions, and receive invitations to speak in a space.
        </p>
        <p class="text-article">
          Other updates to come include the ability to see who is in the user space, as well as put a name or title to the space to add context for members who want to join.

        <h2>Undo sending tweets</h2>
        <p class="text-article">
          The social network Twitter is testing a new button that will allow to undo the sending of a tweet that the user has just published, a function that can only be used within a certain time.
        </p>
        <p class="text-article">
          The new function is displayed in a small window after the publication is sent, as shared by reverse engineering expert Jane Manchun Wong on her profile on the social network
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="../image/img-4.png" alt="Video of how it will be used, hosted on the official account of Jane Manchun Wong">
        </div>
        <p class="text-article">
          As published by TN, in the window you see the notification that "Your tweet was sent" and just below a blue button with the word "undo" (undo). This button shows a progress bar in a darker shade of blue, which would indicate the time the user has to undo the sending of the tweet.
