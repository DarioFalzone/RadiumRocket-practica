			    The appearance of this <span id="important-text">air purifier</span> is identical to that of a flowerpot, but its technology makes it particularly striking since instead of using artificial filters, it uses real plants.
        </p>
        <p class="text-article">
          This device, called Respira, uses real plants to clean the air in the environment of a room just like a natural flowerpot does, but with the difference that it does not require specific conditions.
        </p>

        <h2>A natural purifier plugged into the power</h2>
        <p class="text-article">
          The process used by Respira is the same as that of a natural system: <span id="important-text">biofiltration</span>, by means of which microorganisms near the roots of plants filter bad odors and chemicals from the environment.
        </p>

        <p class="text-article">
          To use it, 13 plants must be placed in its base, introducing the roots, and <span id="important-text">using fans the device absorbs the air and filters it</span>, eliminating dust and other solid particles that float in the environment.
        </p>
        <p class="text-article">
          <span id="important-text">The air reaches the roots of the plants</span>, where the chemicals are trapped, and is purified by another fan.
        </p>

        <p class="text-article">
          During the <span id = "important-text"> process, water is also vaporized, which then comes out together with the air </span>, thus avoiding dryness in the environment of some homes.
        </p>
        <p class="text-article">
          Respira maintenance is simple, as it includes a led system that provides the necessary lighting for the plants, and <span id = "important-text"> it is only necessary to add water every 10 days and fertilizers every 6 months </span> .
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="text-article">
          Through a quality sensor that measures the substances present in the air, the purifier warns when it is necessary to activate it, and also sends reports directly to the cell phone that indicate the state of health of the plants.
        </p>
        <p class="text-article">
          The purifier, whose price is 479 euros without plants and 548 euros with some options that the buyer can choose, will begin to be distributed in June.
